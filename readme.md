## What is Node.js and Why Should You Use It?

#### JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages ​​in the world. Today it is one of the most preferred programming languages ​​by developers and designers to power millions of websites and create features. If you are new to programming, JavaScript is one of the best programming languages ​​that you can easily start learning.

#### For its first 20 years, JavaScript was primarily used for client-side scripting. Because JavaScript can only be used within the <script></script> tag, developers had to work across multiple languages ​​and frameworks between front-end and back-end components. Next came Node.js, a runtime environment that contains everything needed to run a program written in JavaScript.

#### In this article we will try to cover everything about Node.js.

## What NodeJS

#### Node.js is a single-threaded, open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for building fast and scalable server and network applications.
 
#### It runs on the V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O architecture, making it suitable for efficient and real-time applications.

## What Language Is Node.js Written In?

#### Node.js is written in C, C++ and JavaScript.

## Features  of Node.js

#### Node.js has grown rapidly over the past few years. Thanks to the wide list of features it provides, it has become a favorite of developers. Let's take a look at these features:

#### Easy: Getting started with Node.js is pretty easy. It is a good choice for those new to web development. With lots of tutorials and a large community, in short, strong support, getting started with Node.js is easy.
#### Scalable: Provides broad scalability for applications. Being single-threaded, Node.js can handle large numbers of simultaneous connections with high efficiency.
#### Speed: Non-blocking thread execution makes Node.js even faster and more efficient.
#### Packages: There are many open source Node.js packages available that can simplify your work. There are over a million packages in the NPM ecosystem today.
#### Powerful Back-end: Node.js is written in C and C++, this speeds it up and adds features like network support.
#### Multi-platform: Cross-platform support lets you build SaaS websites, desktop apps, and even mobile apps, all using Node.js.
#### Sustainable: Node.js is an easy choice for developers as it can be managed as a single language with both front-end and back-end JavaScript.

## Is Node.js a Programming Language?

#### In one word: no.Node.js is not a programming language. Instead, it is a runtime environment used to run JavaScript outside of the browser.Node.js is not a framework (a platform for developing software applications). The Node.js runtime is built on a programming language (in this case JavaScript) and helps run the frameworks themselves.To summarize, Node.js is neither a programming language nor a framework; In short, node.js is a working environment.

## Getting Started with Node.js
#### Deciding where to start with Node.js can be overwhelming. Luckily, it's simple enough to set up and then you can run test runs for yourself.
